NXP VR5510 pmic

This file describes the binding info for the PMIC driver:

Required properties:
- compatible: "nxp,vr5510"
- reg:
	* 0x20 - Main unit
	* 0x21 - Fail Safe Unit

With those two properties, the pmic device can be used for read/write only.

vr5510 {
	compatible = "nxp,vr5510";
	reg = <0x20>;
	status = "okay";
};

vr5510_fsu {
	compatible = "nxp,vr5510";
	reg = <0x21>;
	status = "okay";
};
