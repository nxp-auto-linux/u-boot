	  An SCMI agent communicates with a related SCMI server firmware
	  located in another sub-system, as a companion micro controller
	  or a companion host in the CPU system.

	  Communications between agent (client) and the SCMI server are
	  based on message exchange. Messages can be exchanged over transport
	  channels as a mailbox device or an Arm SMCCC service with some
	  pieces of identified shared memory.
